# Subscribers' Behaviour Analysis using Machine Learning 

Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. 

In this classification task, I will develop a model that will pick the right plan, employing different Machine Learning algorithms.
